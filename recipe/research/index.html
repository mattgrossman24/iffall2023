            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.hendricksgin.com/">Hendrick's Gin</a> is a great example of the use of illustrated elements for web. I am hoping to build off of this and make my own illustrations in that style for this project.  </a> </li>
                <li><a href="https://badrfood.com/">Badr Food</a> plays with how the user interacts with the ingredients. I love the way the typography and photo elements interact -- hoping to bring some of that into my own site. </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/vegan-pizza-recipe-with-easy-homemade-mozzarella-7568126">Simply Recipe's</a> isn't necisarily layed out in the best way -- I want to play wiht the layout better than they did. However, I really like the small illustrated elements and the yellow callout boxes - it's a great way to add some voice to the website. I could do this by making those callouts with stuff about the extra cheese, different ways of cooking, etc. </li> 
            </ul>
            <h1>Reference Sites - General</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad">Apple's iPad Site</a> is anoter great example of the use of abstracting parts of the visual elements to show what goes into the product/recipe. I love the way that the elements move as you scroll -- I would love to mimic that if we learn how in  </a> </li>
                <li>The <a href="https://la28.org/en.html">LA Olympic Website</a> has a really strong layout that uses all available parts of the screen. I want to play off of this layout for my own designs. It also has some great illustrated examples. </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.taylorswift.com">Taylor Swift's website</a> feels like it's on a piece of paper, and I really like the illustrated feel of it (sensing a pattern in these answers). </li>
