    <h1> Matt Grossman | Intro Questions</h1>
  
    <ol>
        <li>Matt Grossman, sophomore, B.A. Communication Design + Math/Computer Science (Second Major) </li>
        <br>
        <li>I've always been interested in how science, tech, and art can mix. I've always known that I want to work in a creative industry and I'm excited to learn more about the interaction design/product design field. </li>
        <br>
        <li>No experience with any of the three! Just Java from CS131 last semester.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I hope to become proficient enough in CSS and HTML to work on personal & portfolio projects.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I'm particularly excited about color. When desiging for paper, there's always the barrier of going from screen to printer but when designing for screen, the color you see is the color you get. I'm looking forward to playing with more vibrant colors than my print work.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://secretrisoclub.com/"> Secret Riso Club</a> exemplifies effective design. The use of bright colors and illustration highlights what the Riso printer does best. Also, the cursor on the site is really unique.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/04/arts/design/berthe-morisot-in-england.html?action=click&module=card&pageType=theWeekenderLink"> New York Times </a> has a great series of artciles called 'Close Read' that focuses on famous paintings in art history. Instead of using just a picture to communicate, as you scroll to read different parts of the text, the site zooms in and pans over the relevant areas of that painting. This communicates the authors writing in a clear and clever way.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/"> iPad Air website </a> works really well. The interaction between user and screen highlights the product they are selling and helps the user understand what the benefits of this iPad are.</li>
