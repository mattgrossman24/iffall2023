            <h1>Every tattoo or ‘Flash’ is a personal statement but there are certain common meanings. </h1>
            <h2>HERE'S A FEW FAVORITES:</h2>
            <div>
                <img src = "img/mom.svg" alt = "Mom heart tattoo">
                <h2>Heart</h2>
                <h3>A sailor staring down a long stint at sea- including the possibility of not returning home-often wanted a heart tattoo to keep his loved ones close. Sometimes these hearts were just images. Other timehs, they read "Mom" or featured the name of a special girl. Hearts still remain one of the most popular tattoos for both sailors and civilians.</h3>

                <div>
                    <img src = "img/pin-up.svg" alt = "Pin Up Girl tattoo">
                    <img src = "img/pin-up.svg" alt = "Pin Up Girl tattoo">
                </div>
                <h2>Pin Up Girl</h2>
                <h3>Pin-up girls represent the ideal and extremes of femininity — from maidenly perfection to vixen-ish temptation. The woman inked on a sailor's arm would be the only feminine form he would see for months. Applying his bold, refined style to the pin-up, Sailor Jerry created what could be argued as the world's most iconic pin-up tattoos.</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src = "img/eagle.svg" alt = "Eagle tattoo">
                <h2>Eagle</h2>
                <h3>Eagles are symbols for America, representing honor, prowess and intelligence. For Sailor Jerry, as a patriot who was acutely aware of (and vocal about) the shortcomings of his country, the Eagle was a symbol of his idealized America. A country that stands with the courage of its convictions and backs down for no one. Jerry's eagle tattoos are fierce and iconic, often depicted in association with the flag.</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src = "img/skull.svg" alt = "Skull tattoo">
                <h2>Skull</h2>
                <h3>A tattoo is one of the few indelible decisions we make in life, representing a commitment to your dying day — this is one reason skulls and death themes are big. The other is that tattoos, in the ancient world and in Jerry's day, were often the marks of warriors, mercenaries and adventurers – people whose life choices represented coming to terms with death (“Death Or Dishonor”) or perversely inoculating one's self against it (“Rats Get Fat While Brave Men Die”).</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <img src = "img/anchor.svg" alt = "Anchor tattoo">
                <h2>Anchor</h2>
                <h3>At sea, the anchor is the most secure object in a sailor's life, making it the perfect representation of stability. This is why you'll often see anchor tattoos emblazoned with "Mom" or the name of a sailor's sweetheart (the people who keep them grounded). Anchors have become popular within general tattoo culture over the years, but the symbolism is still the same. It's a reminder of what keeps you steady.</h3>
